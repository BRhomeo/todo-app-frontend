.well... Don't worry the app is fully linked with firebase DB, and authintcation, you can login fron any device and check on you tasks...Have fun!

. The app can have many funny & use-full feature, but unfortunately I didn't have enough time, you can sneak into the back-end repo [here](https://github.com/BRhomeo/todo-app-backend) and see some complete features from the back-end such as refrishtoken, delete task,update task, pagenation,  and filtration... but agin the time wasn't one of our friend this time
